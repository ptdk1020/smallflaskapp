# smallflaskapp

This is project where I predict an abalone's age based on its physical measurements. The main goal is to build a Flask application, and deploy it to Heroku. 


~~My app can be found [here](https://abaloneringsprediction.herokuapp.com/). Note that it could take a little longer to load the first time since the Heroku container could be asleep.~~

_2023 Note: since Heroku no longer has a free tier, the above link no longer works._
