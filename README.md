# smallflaskapp

This is project where I predict an abalone's age based on its physical measurements. However, my main goal is to learn how to build a Flask application, and deploy it to Heroku. 

My app can be found [here](https://abaloneringsprediction.herokuapp.com/). Note that it could take a little longer to load the first time since the Heroku container could be asleep.
